🛡️ Wazuh “Lazy” FIM Configuration
Version: 1.0 (Stable) Date: February 3, 2026 Scope: Windows Endpoints (Laptops/Desktops)
Overview
This configuration enables Real-Time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on critical Windows system folders. Unlike standard monitoring which scans every 12 hours, this configuration triggers an immediate alert the second a file is created, modified, or deleted in high-risk "persistence" locations often used by malware and attackers.

Check FIM Documentation.
